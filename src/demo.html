            A complete overhaul is coming for Battle Tracker! The version that you're seeing is just a proof of concept. This demo is written in plain JavaScript and has very limited functionality; in fact, it doesn't do anyone much good unless the only creature you're woried about keeping track of is one mimic.
            <br>
            Fortuately, a completely new version is coming very soon, built in React from the ground up. The complete version boasts a variety of features, like being able to select multiple creatures from an API or from custom values, log in and log out functionality, and a slimed down and optimized version of the status effect functionality.
            <br><br>
            Please look forward to it in the future!
        </p>
